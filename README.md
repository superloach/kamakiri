A simple physics engine in Go.

This started out as a port of Raylib's [Physac](https://github.com/victorfisac/Physac), but I eventually realized there was so much I wanted to change, that it would be reasonable to make it my own project. I don't claim to understand most of the math stuff that goes into this.

## usage
```go
// Wait for the api to stabilize, dork.
```
